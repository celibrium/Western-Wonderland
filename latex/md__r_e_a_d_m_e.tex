\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Run {\bfseries{brew info sfml}}
\item Locate the correct path needed (for example some users may get {\itshape L/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/\+Cellar/sfml/2.\+6.\+1/lib})
\item Retry the {\bfseries{g++}} command with the correct path to get sfml to run properly

Welcome to Western Wonderland -- a Western University adaptation of The Game of Life. We wanted to create a game highlighting our fond university memories throughout the past few years. This game supports 2 players.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Instructions\+:}{Instructions:}}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md7}

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Players will select their major (Western or Ivey), determining their path for the first half of the game, as well as the amount of resources that you start the game with.
\item Throughout the game, GPA, student debt, and happiness will be tracked for each player. The game\textquotesingle{}s goal is to maximize GPA and happiness while minimizing student debt. The winner of the game will be determined based on how many of these categories you \textquotesingle{}win\textquotesingle{}. The winner will be determined once both players reach the end of the board during a graduation event.
\item To spin the wheel, press the spacebar on your keyboard. Players will take turns spinning the wheel, determining the number of spaces their marker moves on the board. Turns will alternate until both players have reached the end of the board.
\item \doxylink{struct_event}{Event} spaces are special spaces indicated by colour tiles on the board. \doxylink{struct_event}{Event} spaces tell a story about a memorable university experience and affect your in-\/game resources.
